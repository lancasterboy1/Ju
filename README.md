A currency designed to be as secure as possible while promoting fast transaction rates

Planned work on the coin:
- improve cryptographic security
- design holding consolidation algorithm

- streamline blocks
- add maximum block size (~1 Gb)

Currently Planned additional Projects:
1) An easy to use wallet management application with basic 'banking' functionality
2) a web applet to allow online retailers to accept payment
3) A one-click miner/node setup
4) A Point of sale (POS) application, ideally which works in conjunction with 1)
5) A exchange application which works with 1)
6) an ebay clone that allows users to post goods/services in exchange for the coin

Additional goals:
- Create website which provides information about the currency, what makes us special.
- Create forums for disscussion and Q & A
- promote spending as much as possible
